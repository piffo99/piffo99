## Hi there! :wave:
My name is Damir(piffo), I'm a Unity game developer and C# programmer. I'm from Russia. I'm currently developing games on the Unity engine.
In free time, I improve my skills in coding, IT and everything related to it. I am also fond of exact sciences, gaming, films and series:relaxed:
### Products and projects :computer:
At the moment I have released the game on Steam: [The Simplest Game on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569560/The_Simplest_Game/).
And many interesting projects are being developed right now!
